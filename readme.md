# Getcord
Due to my personal experience with running different version of Linux (aka distro hopping),  
I've encountered a recurring issue- Manually installing Discord. Now, why do it by hand, if I can write a tool that  
does it for me?

## Goals
- [ ] CLI Functionality.
- [ ] Auto updater.
- [ ] Installs Discord without further input needed.
